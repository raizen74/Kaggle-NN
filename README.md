# Kaggle-NN
Given 900000 instances and 31 features representing manufacturing control data, build a neural network to predict whether the machine is in state 0 or state 1. 

- 51% of the machines are in state 0 and 49% in state 1.

My model achieved 97,4% accuracy prediction on test data, topping the chart of the [ML kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/competicioiimludg2023).
